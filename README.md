# Introduction-to-System-Integration-and-Architecture

One of my expectations for this subject is to gain knowledge about how different hardware and software components communicate and interact with each other. I look forward to learning various integration methods, design principles, and architectural frameworks that are widely used in modern information systems. I also expect the course to cover practical applications, such as system testing, troubleshooting, and performance evaluation.

I also look forward to the practical side of this subject. Aside from theories and concepts, I expect to engage in projects or case studies that will allow me to apply what I learn in real-world scenarios. By working on actual system integration exercises, I can develop problem-solving skills, teamwork, and critical thinking, which are all necessary in professional environments.

Finally, I expect this subject to help me grow both academically and personally. I anticipate that it will challenge me to think beyond simple coding or programming and instead view technology as a system of interconnected parts.
